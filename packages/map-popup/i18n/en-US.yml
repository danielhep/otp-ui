# Default messages for the MapPopup component.
# To use from a react-intl application:
# - merge the content of this file into the messages object
#   that has your other localized strings,
# - flatten the ids, i.e. convert a structure such as
#      otpUi > MapPopup > stopViewer
#   into "otpUi.MapPopup.stopViewer" (see TripDetail story for an example),
# - pass the resulting object to the messages prop of IntlProvider.
#
# The meaning of the pseudo <tags> used in the strings below is as follows:
# - <dietaryLink>: The link to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans will surround the text enclosed by the tag.
# - <strong>: The enclosed text will be rendered as strong (bold) text (same meaning as in HTML).

  MapPopup:
    availableBikes: "Available bikes: {value}"
