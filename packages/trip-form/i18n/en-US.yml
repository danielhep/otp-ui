# Default messages for components in the trip-form package.
# To use from a react-intl application:
# - merge the content of this file into the messages object
#   that has your other localized strings,
# - flatten the ids, i.e. convert a structure such as
#      otpUi > DateTimeSelector > now
#   into "otpUi.DateTimeSelector.now" (see the DateTimeSelector story for an example),
# - pass the resulting object to the messages prop of your IntlProvider.
