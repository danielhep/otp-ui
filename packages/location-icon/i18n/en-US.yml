# Default messages for the LocationIcon component.
# To use from a react-intl application:
# - merge the content of this file into the messages object
#   that has your other localized strings,
# - flatten the ids, i.e. convert a structure such as
#      otpUi > LocationIcon > from
#   into "otpUi.LocationIcon.from" (see TripDetail story for an example),
# - pass the resulting object to the messages prop of IntlProvider.

otpUi:
  LocationIcon:
    from: "From"
    to: "To"
    locationIcon: "Location Icon"
